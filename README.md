The project reads data of staff members and allocates each staff members to each class depending on their subject and number of hours they have to put into to complete the portions. A time table is generated as per the given criteria.
You will need XAMPP or WAMP server to run the code as the web browser doesn't allow cross scripts, basically to prevent XSS type attacks.
Any form of help is greatly appreciated.
